#### Original data visualization:

This visualization was used in an article named "Science remains male-dominated" in The Economist. I found this topic quite interesting and was curious about how the article is going to demonstrate its viewpoint. After I look through the article and the visualization, I made the following table about how I think of this visualization:
<table>
    <tr>
      <td>Advantages</td>
      <td>Disadvantages</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>1. Valid information. The data includes different countries and different fields.<br> 2. Color usage. Different color represents different fields. 50% line is highlighted in orange color so that readers can have a clear sight of those fields that achieves 50%.  </td>
      <td>1. Inconsistent logos. The Patent was represented in the circle and other fields were represented in rectangles. The circles look more obvious on the chart, which might give readers the wrong impression that circle matters more than rectangles. <br> 2. Some overlapping between rectangles. The space is small and there is too much information. <br> 3. The numbers are written on the x-axis, but in convention, it appears more on the y-axis. <br> 4. Inconsistent alignment. </td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Working Progress
First of all, I followed Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile and evaluated the above visualization based on Usefulness, Completeness, Perceptibility, Truthfulness, Intuitiveness, Aesthetics, and Engagement. This critique method makes me realized that there are both subjective and objective parts of data visualization. This explains why I sometimes feel a chart is not very good nor very bad. It might have a good data source but the color usage is making me uncomfortable. When doing the critique, separating those two parts can help me better understand the strengths/weaknesses of the chart. As a result, during the redesign, I decided to remain the good part of the original chart and improve the weak part. The article gives two points, "Science remains male-dominated" and "females are catching up." The article spends quite a lot of words and sentences supporting the later viewpoint, but this part was not shown in the visualization at all. There is no trend in the chart. And this is why I feel the data is not very complete. However, it indeed shows that "Science remains male-dominated." So I decided that my redesign will mainly focus on how to effectively and clearly show "Science remains male-dominated."

The context of my redesign is that the primary audience for this dataviz would be people(more targeted at females) doing scientific research such as students, professors, researchers, and so on. Each individual might care more about the situation in his/her own fields/country. It would be better if the visualization can separate the content into smaller sub-charts or use a more clear way to represent the data rather than just mix everything into one single chart. I used Infogram for my wireframes.

For me, the biggest problem in the original chart is that there is too much information in one small chart. So I chose grouped bars because it can show data within/between different groups. This is what my [draft](https://infogram.com/busy-charts-1hkv2nd130zp6x3?live) looks like.

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="c17e4690-5633-4eb5-a61a-2d799cccbc7c" data-type="interactive" data-title="Busy Charts"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/c17e4690-5633-4eb5-a61a-2d799cccbc7c" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Busy Charts</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>


I used different colors to represent different fields, just like the way it is in the original chart. And then I showed my draft to my friends and asked for some feedback. I found two pieces of advice very helpful. One said the scale of numberson the y-axis is too large. The bars are mainly in the lower parts of the chart, makes it hard to compare among different groups. The reason I set 0-1 is that I wanted to show the large empty upper part indicates the low proportion of the women paper publishers. Well, the visualization is for the reader to understand, not just the designer. The other advice is about the title of x-axis. One of my friends was confused about what those countries mean. The nationality of the publishers or the place where the papers are published. This was indeed a good point! 

In the end, I choose to use grouped bars to show the current women publishers ratio situation in the science-related world. I used different colors to represent different fields. The readers can choose to see data only from the field(s) they are interested in. They may also just focus on one or two countries/regions to see the overall situation within that country/region.
