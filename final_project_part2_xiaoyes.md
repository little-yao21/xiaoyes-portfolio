## Final project Part II

In Part II I will continue constructing and refining the actual narrative that will take the reader on the journey through my story. <br>
Wireframes/storyboards and user research will be included in this page. 

For content in Part I (copies to working datasets, outline and sketches of final project, method and medium planned on using) please check [this site.](/final_project_part1_xiaoyes.md) <br>
For content in Part III (Final Deliverable) please check [this site.](/final_project_part3_xiaoyes.md) <br>

### Story Board
I used shorthand to form my story board. You can click on [this link.](https://preview.shorthand.com/fqGgLtwwhOV2UdGd)

### User research
a. Target audience:<br>
People who loves to drink bubble tea.

b. Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview:<br>

People who likes to share photos of drinking bubble tea will be a good target.
Sample target will be choosen from my friends (whom I have access to their social media.)

c. Interview script:<br>

    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>1.Do you like drinking boba tea? If yes, how often do you drink? What's your favorite toppings and sweetness level? </td>
      <td>All of my interviewee enjoy drinking boba tea (but not crazy lovers. Frequency is around once a week). They have control over sweetness level(often 50%-70% sweetness is enough). </td>
      <td>NA</td>   
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2.What do you think is the topic of this story? </td>
      <td> All interviewees quickly understand that my story is about the health risk associated with boba tea. But some pointed out that there might be a time/space arrangement issue in my story. Currently I'm giving similar weights(time and space in story telling) to my introduction and health risk part, and therefore my story is being divided into (40,40,20) structure. </td>
      <td>I will change my story structure into (25,50,25) structure. Talk less in introduction part, put more focus on health issue and call to action. Specifically speaking, I might remove "sales of boba tea in China" chart. And add visuliazation that links excessive sugar intake with disease in health risk part. </td>   
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3.Was this story clear and easy to understand? Did you feel engaged? </td>
      <td>All my interviewees enjoyed "watching" my story. The feedback on this quesition is quite positive. People do enjoy seeing beautiful graphs and charts much more than reading scripts.</td>
      <td>I will pay attention to the size of graphs and charts in my story board. Large graphs that take up the whole screen is very tired to see. Keep my current story style.</td>   
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4.Do the use of data and visualizations support the presentation? Was that useful and informative? </td>
      <td>The feedback on this quesition is also quite positive. What is shown there is informative. But there can be more related information being presented in my story. For example, on suggestion is that: For the popularity map shown for U.S., it might be better if I change the data into showing the popularity trends. Currently the map is telling the audience that level of boba tea popularity differs among states. But the goal of introduction part is to show how popular boba tea is, not comparing which states like it more. By using a line chart(x for time, y for search interest), we can have a better view of "boba tea is becoming more and more popular in U.S."</td>
      <td>I will change the current heat map into a line chart(or maybe other type) that can show trends through time.</td>   
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5.Can you tell me a part you liked the most? </td>
      <td>Graphs. I received a lot of positive feedbacks on the graphs I used in the storyboard. They are enjoyable to watch. Someone also mentioned that relating numbers to common things and activity in our daily life makes my story clearer and more convincing. </td>
      <td>NA </td>   
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6.Did you find any places that were confusing? </td>
      <td>Some people feel that the DIY part seems a little bit too short. Rather than feeling confused, my interviewee felt a sense of sudden stop. They were expecting for more content to continue, but it just finished. I guess i didn't make a good ending of my story. Perhaps I should point out my core idea once again in the end. Also, another point is, although I used visualization to explain the data number of boba tea components, people might still think "yes it's a lot of sugar, but how much is called too much? And what's wrong with too much?" That is to say, may be I can provide a sugar intake standard from some official health organizations. Or take one step further about why taking so many sugar is going to be a problem. Based on my Part I, TA also suggested that "I also like that you consider including something about obesity, perhaps also include diabetes, and how sugary drinks contribute to both." For health issue, too much sugar alone is not enough, I should also talk about what's wrong with too much sugar.</td>
      <td>Due to the limited presentation time, I will try to add one or two charts showing the bad consequence of consuming too much sugar. Probably showing the correlation between getting diabetes/obesity and sugar intake amount. If this data is hard to find, I will just focus on adding suagr intake standard to better inform my audience. </td>   
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7. Is there a clear call to action or next step? </td>
      <td>Yes. The "What should we do?" sentence was said to be a clear sign for call to action. But just as mentioned in above, the content of DIY can be expanded a little bit. Currently I have a chart showing the calories contained in 1 gram of different types of sugar. By DIY, we can choose the sugar that contains the lowest calories. This helps but just seems not helpful enough. Calories along might not be persuasive enough for the action to be taken. </td>
      <td>I will add a chart about the Glycemic Index (a measure of how quickly a carbohydrate food raises blood glucose levels, related to diabetes) of different sugar. With this extra information, audience can better understand how sugar in boba tea might cause health related issue. </td>   
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8.After seeing this story, would you change your frequency of buying boba tea? or Would you try to DIY boba tea at home?</td>
      <td>I was glad to hear my interviewees saying they would choose to lower buying frequency. But based on question 1, all of my interviewees already have certain control over the sweetness level of boba tea. So they are not crazy lovers of sweet beverage from the very beginning. It would make more sense if people who originally enjoy drinking sweet beverages decides to lower their frequency after hearing my story. </td>
      <td>Before the final presentation, I will try to find some "sugar lovers" to be my audience. And see whether this story works for them or not.  </td>
