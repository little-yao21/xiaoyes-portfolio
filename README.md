This is xiaoye's portfolio for 20Fall Telling Story with Data!

# About me
My name is Xiaoye Shao, a MISM-16 second-year student.
Terrible drawer, but excited about this fun course.
Want to be a Java software engineer after graduation.

# What I hope to learn
Learn to create better data visualizations supported by narrative (really need this skill in Pres, good visualization leads to effective communication).
Learn some theories about nice color combinations, be able to choose various ways to represent data based on the needs, tell a good story with the help of my data.
