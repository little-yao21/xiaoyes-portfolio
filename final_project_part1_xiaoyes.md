Call to action: Drink moderate amount of bubble tea.

#### Initial sketches
I used Infogram to do my initial sketches. All the numbers/graphs put in there are subject to change. <br>
Bacially, my story consists of three parts: popularity of bubble tea, health issue related with bubble tea and call to action. These three topics will also serve as key headers in my story (The exact expression might change, but the key idea will remian the same.) I will use different types of chart, colors, fonts to highlight all the data. Since I only have less than 2 minutes to present, I probably won't use complex charts. Simple but clear charts might be better options. 

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="7cad1e95-0ecd-4098-add1-c39be05d8885" data-type="interactive" data-title="Busy Charts"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/7cad1e95-0ecd-4098-add1-c39be05d8885" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Busy Charts</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>


#### The data
1. Popularity analysis from: 
    a.[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=boba) This data can be used to show how people in different parts of the United States pay attention to bubble tea. The assumption behind this data is that: the more search they did, the more they are interested in bubble tea and thus the higher score they will have.<br>
    b."Tasty Milk Tea Analysis" from [MeiTuan.com](https://about.meituan.com/detail/36) This is the "2019 China beverage industry trend development report" released by Meituan.com at the end of 2018. The report contains a lot of market data for the bubble tea industry in China. Through these data, we can see the great popularity/achievements of bubble tea shops in China.<br>
    c. [Other data](https://www.menusifu.com/zh/us-bubble-tea-market-report/) talking about bubble tea market in the U.S.<br><br>

However, as bubble tea become more and more popular through out the world, many health concerns arise as well. In May 2011, a food scandal occurred in Taiwan when DEHP (a chemical plasticizer) was found as a stabilizer in drinks and juice syrups. Of course by now，with increased supervision, bubble tea won't contain any serious health-threatening agents such as excessive levels of heavy-metal contaminants.  However, ingredients like non-dairy creamer and toppings in the tea raises the fat and sugar content of the tea and increases the risk of chronic diseases in long term. Based on these infomation, I plan to show the possible health issues related with bubble tea by analyzing its ingredients.<br><br>
 
2. Bubble tea ingredients analysis from:<br>
    a.[Calories and sugars in boba milk tea: implications for obesity risk in Asian Pacific Islanders](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5217910/) This is a scientific report focusing on calories and sugars in the bubble tea. The authors used a series of modern techniques to quantify the ingredients, and those recorded data can be used to tell the story. One problem is that, the number it self won't connect with the audience. For example, if I say one serving of bubble tea contains 36 gram sugar, the audience won't necessary understand 36 is in fact a very high number. I need to link those numbers with some actual objects in people's daily life. If I say 36 gram of sugar equals 9 sugar cubes, the audience might feel: oh that's a little bit too much. One step further, if I tell them recommended intake for sugar is 25 gram per day, the audience will then know for sure that: bubble tea contains too manu sugar. <br>
    b.[Milk Tea Component Analysis Conducted by Shanghai Consumer Council](http://www.shanghai.gov.cn/nw2/nw2314/nw2315/nw17239/nw26487/u21aw1245796.html) This is an experiment conducted by Shanghai Consumer Council. They tested 50 bubble teas from several different brands and found that most of them have high quantity(more than standard) of sugar/fat. The experiment report also contains useful data, which can be used in my final project.<br>


#### Method and medium
For now I plan on building my story using Shorthand. I will spend one or two days tring to figure out how Shorthand works. And then, based on my project outline and initial sketches, I will use all the correct/final data to construct my main charts. Since I feel like my story line is quite clear, I will first put more emphasis on making good/clear/nice charts. After that, I will organize all my elements into shorthand (titles, headers, transition parts, charts), and form a initial layout. Then I will ask some of my friends to be the audience and listen to my story for several times.(reciving advice, making changes/improvements, practice, and all over again.) In the end, I think my project will be ready to go.
